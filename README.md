## Revitalizing 2Market: Unveiling Customer Insights and Cultivating Data-Driven Decision-Making
2Market, a company involved in both online and in-store sales from 2012 to 2014, seeks to enhance its brand image and competitiveness. To address this, a focused analysis is essential. This project aims to understand 2Market's customer base, including demographics, advertising channel effectiveness, top-selling products, and demographic-based variations in product popularity. The project also explores average spending patterns across countries and examines how customers' educational backgrounds impact social media effectiveness and product popularity. Ultimately, the goal is to provide insights and recommendations for informed and strategic decision-making at 2Market.
## Streamlined Technical Analysis and Data Integration

#### Data Cleaning and Demographic Insight:
Utilizing Excel, I performed rigorous data cleaning on 2Market's dataset, addressing duplicates, adding an age column, fixing date formats, and enhancing visual appeal through formatting and sorting. This process yielded valuable insights into customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and preferences.

#### Sales Analysis for Strategic Insights:
The analysis extended to examining 2Market's sales, identifying consumption patterns across regions and demographics. Relationships between products and demographic factors such as countries, age groups, and relationship statuses were explored for a comprehensive understanding.

#### Stakeholder Communication and Data Concerns:
Addressing uncertainties, I raised concerns about disproportionate data representation for certain countries, notably Montenegro and Spain. Additionally, the limited time range (2012-2014) prompted a discussion about gaining a holistic understanding of company insights and developments.

#### Excel File Integrity and Insights:
The marketing_data Excel file revealed no spelling mistakes, blank cells, or errors. An overview of data type corrections and enhancements, including age calculation and marital status consolidation, was presented. Surprising findings related to marital status and age distribution were shared through pivot tables and scatterplots.

#### Seamless Data Integration with SQL:
Importing the cleaned marketing_data into SQL required no further cleaning. The ad_data CSV file was efficiently checked for 'NULL' values and duplicates using SQL syntaxes. The integration of both files was achieved seamlessly through 'JOIN' operations.

#### Uncovering Correlations:
A noteworthy observation emerged, highlighting a correlation between total spend per product per country and the number of successful social media conversions. This correlation suggests potential areas for optimization and strategic focus.

In summary, this streamlined technical approach ensures accurate and reliable data, providing a foundation for informed decision-making and reinforcing our strategic direction. The detailed steps and insights are outlined in the accompanying appendix.

#### Key Findings:
Upon data import, a clear trend emerges, showcasing alcohol and meat items as the top spending categories. The majority of 2Market's clientele is concentrated in Spain, South Africa, and Canada. Potential scenarios suggest a significant presence or local representation in these countries, contributing to an expanded customer base.

#### Purchase Patterns:
Analysis of in-store and online purchases from 2012 to 2014 reveals a distinct preference for in-store transactions. This preference aligns with a noteworthy correlation between the surge in customer complaints in 2013 and the subsequent decline in sales in 2014.

#### Global Strategy Considerations:
Another plausible scenario suggests that 2Market may not have actively targeted or invested in operations in other countries. A detailed examination of consumer spending and income across different countries indicates similar levels, with a conspicuous scarcity of data for Montenegro. This absence potentially signifies operational prioritization challenges during the specified years.

#### Objective:
These refined insights aim to equip stakeholders with valuable data for strategic decision-making in 2Market's future initiatives. Feel free to explore and leverage these findings to enhance your understanding of market dynamics and optimize business strategies.

## Recommendations
2Market is advised to continue advertising across all social media platforms, with a preference for Instagram and Twitter over Facebook due to their higher effectiveness. Additionally, a detailed assessment of the impact of bulk mail and brochure advertisements is recommended.

To better understand customer purchasing behavior, further investigation into online versus in-store shopping preferences, as well as the frequency of utilizing both options, is suggested. This valuable information can inform targeted advertising efforts.

It is recommended that the company re-establish country-specific strategies to enhance sales. Utilizing highly effective advertising methods, particularly on Twitter and through Bulkmail, can be instrumental in maximizing revenue, especially for products with lower sales, such as vegetables.

Despite a stable total income, there has been a significant decline in item sales compared to previous years (2012 and 2013). It is essential to evaluate additional factors and make necessary adjustments to address this decline and optimize overall revenue.
